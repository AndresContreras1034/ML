# Machine Learning Repository

This repository brings together theory and practical projects in Machine Learning.  
The goal is to consolidate study notes, implemented algorithms, and applied experiments in one place.

## Contents

- Fundamental theory: basic concepts, classic algorithms, deep learning.
- Practical projects: classification, regression, NLP, computer vision.
- Notebooks: experiments, tests, and results.
- Resources: datasets and supporting utilities.

## Suggested Organization

- theory/ → summaries and notes
- projects/ → practical cases organized in folders
- notebooks/ → Jupyter notebooks with experiments
- datasets/ → data used
- utils/ → helper scripts and functions

## How to Use This Repository

1. Clone the repository
2. Create and activate a virtual environment
3. Install dependencies with `requirements.txt`
4. Open notebooks or run scripts inside each project

## Next Steps

- Expand theory with visual examples
- Add metrics and comparative results across algorithms
- Document each project with an internal README
